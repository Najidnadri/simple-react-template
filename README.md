# Getting Started with Simple React Template

It is suprisingly hard to find a well organized `React` beginner-template out there with all the basic features included. Hence, I created this repo. There's really nothing much added to this repo besides some utils to make your development easier. So you dont really need to worry about any other third-party dependencies learning.

This repo uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [React Scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) as the base foundation.

## Features
- 100% Typescript
- Organized projects folders
- Easy global state management (See `store` directory)
- Easy page routing management (see `router` directory)

## Installation
Clone this repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Najidnadri/simple-react-template <project-name>
```
Go into your project folder and install dependencies
```bash
cd <project-name>
npm ci
```
Finally, run in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
